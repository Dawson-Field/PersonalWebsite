As a student and university ambassador at Utah State University, I constantly seek new opportunities to learn and grow in the field. I am currently in a role as a logistics clerk at Blackstone Products, where I am able to apply my knowledge and skills in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.

At Blackstone Products, I have honed my abilities to manage orders and coordinate shipments. Through my work, I have developed a keen attention to detail and a strong sense of accountability, which have proven invaluable in my academic and professional pursuits.

As a university ambassador, I am committed to serving as a positive representative for Utah State University and promoting the institution's values and offerings. I am a dedicated and enthusiastic team player, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can leverage my strengths to drive success.

I am confident that my unique skill set and passion for learning will enable me to make meaningful contributions in any role. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to connect or learn more about my experiences!
